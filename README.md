A dead simple and secure open-source crates plugin! Barrel is a response to other crate plugins out there, such as [Crazy Crates](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/crazy-crates.17599/), which has some glaring issues with security and code quality, and [Crate Reloaded](spigotmc.org/resources/free-crate-reloaded-mystery-crate-1-8-1-14-x.861/), which still doesn't have official support for the latest version. 

Barrel aims to be extremely easy to configure, while still providing all of the features of the other aforementioned plugins. It uses Kerosene's Gui library to keep the plugin itself as lightweight as possible.

Barrel is completely open source, so feel free to use it and modify it as you wish. Barrel depends on [Kerosene](https://github.com/FirestarterMC/Kerosene). âœ¨
